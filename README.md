amonks [5:53 PM] 
we ​_could_​ probably start a “boutique” ad network

[5:53] 
not do data stuff

[5:53] 
vet advertisers for “goodness"

[5:54] 
(somehow)

[5:54] 
maybe target a particular indie community

[5:54] 
and give a cut to users

[5:54] 
but that sounds hard and long-term

[5:54] 
we can’t just like

[5:54] 
put it out there and walk away

[5:55] 
maybe we could

taylor [5:55 PM] 
What if it was like an saic thing

amonks [5:55 PM] 
i’m not tryna run that

[5:55] 
i’m graduating

taylor [5:55 PM] 
Would there be a way to just set it up to run itself? Prolly not?

amonks [5:56 PM] 
maybe

[5:56] 
like

[5:56] 
accept anything from an saic email address?

taylor [5:56 PM] 
Cause everything changes all the times there would need to be some upkeep

[5:56] 
Yeah

amonks [5:56 PM] 
hmm

[5:57] 
any week, anyone with @saic can pay 20$ and submit a gif

[5:58] 
and then those ads are shown for that week

[5:58] 
that wouldn’t necessarily be too hard actually

taylor [5:59 PM] 
Yeah, could be succesful

amonks [5:59 PM] 
let’s see

[5:59] 
the server needs to:

[5:59] 
- keep track of who paid 20$

[5:59] 
- keep track of the gifs

[5:59] 
- keep a database of users

[5:59] 
- keep payment information for all of the users

[6:00] 
- keep a bank account or something to hold the 20$ses until payment

[6:00] 
- handle bank transfers to users every week/month/whatever

[6:01] 
- ^ which means it’d need to figure out how to divvy the money between users

[6:01] 
- proportional by pageview? (one person could just automate hitting refresh all day and get the whole $20)

[6:02] 
- evenly to each bank account? (we’d have to make sure ppl didn’t just turn off the plugin and keep getting $$ ; or maybe we wouldn't)

[6:02] 
this is starting to sound hard too

taylor [6:04 PM] 
haha yeah. And we would need to continue it as a business, and that's a lot of commitment, and im sure administration wouldnt like students makingk money off other students

amonks [6:05 PM] 
i’m not so sure about administration

[6:05] 
but i feel you re commitment

[6:05] 
i wonder if we could find ways around any of those things

[6:06] 
maybe we just call it an art thing and users don’t get paid

[6:06] 
we make it 5$

[6:06] 
​*we*​ take the 5$

[6:06] 
and the gifs are art rather than ads

[6:06] 
I’m down to make sure a gif isn’t spam if I’m getting 5$

[6:06] 
and also I’d def consider getting saic arts up in my browser for free just for fun

taylor [6:07 PM] 
So people submit gifs and they are curated through a plugin?

amonks [6:07 PM] 
yeah

[6:07] 
there’s a website where you can pay 5$ and submit a gif

[6:07] 
we look at the gifs and make sure they aren’t spam (or whatever)

taylor [6:07 PM] 
Yeah, that sounds cool. Would they link to a webpage?

[6:08] 
Like artist page

[6:08] 
Or nah

amonks [6:08 PM] 
and then once approved, gifs show up in the browser of whomever downloads the plugin

[6:08] 
yeah sure

[6:08] 
link makes sense

[6:08] 
or maybe that’s spammy

taylor [6:08 PM] 
Yeah I can't decide if that's spammy or not?

[6:08] 
Maybe its not, we are basically a gallery

[6:09] 
Website with an upload form (gif , link)

amonks [6:09 PM] 
[[laptop died]]

[6:10] 
maybe it links to some plain text

[6:10] 
hosted on our website

[6:10] 
that can include or not include links

[6:10] 
to other things

[6:10] 
and we have clear criteria for what counts as spam

[6:11] 
i like that ppl could have links to art stuff

[6:11] 
but a “any link is spam” policy is easier to enforce

taylor [6:12 PM] 
Maybe it can just be a like a hover to reveal artist name? But you can't click it?

amonks [6:12 PM] 
i’m not into hover

[6:13] 
if that was the goal I’d say click for a page on our website with artist name, a permanent archive of the image, and whatever else

taylor [6:13 PM] 
Ohhh I see

[6:13] 
Hm

amonks [6:13 PM] 
but that’s the same basic idea

[6:13] 
of not allowing links

taylor [6:13 PM] 
Yeah

amonks [6:13 PM] 
but maybe ppl would do cool stuff with links

[6:13] 
hmm

[6:14] 
trust vs freedom

[6:14] 
it’s more “art” to say anything goes

taylor [6:14 PM] 
I feel like if people are gonna pay, they want to promote

amonks [6:14 PM] 
yeah

taylor [6:15 PM] 
Maybe we don't facilitate anything?

amonks [6:15 PM] 
but I think I’d rather have it be ads ​*as*​ art than ads ​*for*​ art

taylor [6:15 PM] 
True

amonks [6:15 PM] 
and if a dollar gets you a week of ppls eyeballs

[6:15] 
or whatever

[6:15] 
there’s a price point at which it’s p reasonable

[6:15] 
to not expect to get reward in clicks back

taylor [6:18 PM] 
Would we have an idea on how many people are using the plugin?

amonks [6:18 PM] 
maybe

[6:19] 
at minimum we’d know how many times he had to serve each gif

[6:19] 
and the ip addresses we served them to

[6:19] 
bundling those logs into something meaningful/readable is effort-but-possible

[6:20] 
we could also have the plugin report back in types of ways

[6:20] 
but I’d be less into that tbh

[6:20] 
we’re granting ourselves a lot of power with replacing stuff on every website

[6:20] 
I feel like the plugin should do that in as plain and transparent a way possible

[6:21] 
like

taylor [6:21 PM] 
Yeah, maybe that's not important. Just providing the platform for more eyes

amonks [6:21 PM] 
yeah

[6:21] 
non-saic ppl can download the plugin

[6:21] 
and eventually non-saic ppl could be allowed to submit gifs

[6:22] 
but it’d make it harder to moderate maybe

[6:22] 
but anyway we’d be pretty empowered to make growth-or-not decisions and have it be cool either way

taylor [6:23 PM] 
Yeah. we just start with saic

[6:25] 
Or maybe we start with no restrictions

[6:25] 
No no nvm

[6:25] 
Upload with saic email

amonks [6:29 PM] 
ok

[6:29] 
so now mechanics

[6:29] 
re charging

[6:29] 
i see a couple options:

[6:29] 
- n$ gets you in the pool for a week, each ad is randomly chosen from the pool (edited)

[6:30] 
- n$ gets you in the pool, which contains the most recent x submissions (edited)

[6:31] 
- pay what you will: if in the last week, ppl have paid 100$ and you paid 5 of them, your ad will show up 1 in 20 times

[6:32] 
- n$ gets you x pageviews. if there are no bought pageviews left, everyone just goes ad-free

[6:32] 
i kinda like the pay what you will one

[6:33] 
but I also like the idea of making the system favor the ppl with most money less

[6:33] 
or like not give them a disproportionate advantage

taylor [6:34 PM] 
Ha yeah but also more money.. Lol
I like option 2 the most

amonks [6:34 PM] 
word

[6:34] 
can you submit the same gif twice to get two slots in the pool?

[6:34] 
can you submit multiple gifs into the pool at the same time, or is it one-per-week-per-email?

[6:35] 
i like limiting by email

[6:35] 
(/credit card at scale)

taylor [6:35 PM] 
Yeah I think that's a good idea

[6:36] 
It would be super easy to spam if not

amonks [6:36 PM] 
yeah

[6:36] 
but expensive

[6:36] 
anyway yeah, limit by email

[6:37] 
actually

[6:37] 
I think email is harder than credit card

taylor [6:37 PM] 
Oh yeah, forgot about Payment. In which case I don't think it matters

[6:37] 
We would still be facilitating more money more views

amonks [6:37 PM] 
well

taylor [6:37 PM] 
But, idk. I feel at the scale we are at it won't matter much

amonks [6:37 PM] 
let’s say the pool contains the last 20 submissions

[6:38] 
if someone pays 100$, they can submit 20 gifs and buy the whole pool

[6:38] 
is that good or bad?

[6:38] 
idk

[6:38] 
i think bad tho

[6:38] 
for plugin-users

taylor [6:38 PM] 
I think bad, but not necessarily at first

amonks [6:39 PM] 
yeah true

[6:39] 
a few ppl doing it a lot

taylor [6:39 PM] 
I don't see somebody doing that right off the batt

amonks [6:39 PM] 
is probably good for growth

[6:39] 
still i think it’s better to think this stuff through and be clear than to change policy mid course

[6:40] 
for community stuff like this where ppl get attached

taylor [6:40 PM] 
Mm yeah true

amonks [6:40 PM] 
being liked is pretty key

[6:41] 
actually

[6:41] 
I think I’m leaning towards

[6:41] 
the pool contains the last week’s worth of submissions (however many that is)

[6:41] 
but each person can only submit once per week

[6:41] 
or

[6:41] 
say

[6:41] 
5 times per week

taylor [6:42 PM] 
Yeah I would say 5 times a week.

amonks [6:42 PM] 
once per day?

[6:42] 
that’s easy

taylor [6:42 PM] 
Yeah

amonks [6:42 PM] 
cool

[6:43] 
so what do we need

taylor [6:43 PM] 
Do the gifs change on page loads?

amonks [6:43 PM] 
yeah

[6:43] 
i figure we have a url like artads.com/gimme-an-ad

[6:43] 
that goes to a random one from the pool

[6:43] 
and then the plugin can just keep hitting that url

[6:44] 
- a thing that takes 5$ and a gif, and adds that gif to the moderation queue

[6:45] 
- a thing that shows a moderator a gif from the moderation queue, lets them click yes or no, and adds it to the pool or not

[6:45] 
- a thing that takes gifs out of the pool after a week

taylor [6:45 PM] 
[I'm on my phone and its not loading the site] but im following

amonks [6:45 PM] 
- a thing that picks a random gif from the pool (the url)

[6:46] 
oh that wasn’t a real link

[6:46] 
i just made it up

taylor [6:46 PM] 
Oh haha

amonks [6:46 PM] 
- a browser plugin

[6:47] 
I think minimally

[6:47] 
we can skip the moderation

[6:47] 
skip the time-to-live

[6:47] 
and skip the plugin

[6:47] 
so yeah

[6:47] 
today

[6:47] 
my goal is to make a page you can upload a gif to

[6:48] 
and a url that points to a random uploaded gif

[6:48] 
and we can go from there

```
