Nick!

We (taylor and I) are making a thingy called radblock. It's like adblock, except it replaces ads with user-submitted art.

We have a webpage where someone can upload a gif [1], and another thingy that builds a list of the gifs [2].

Here's the pitch:

**for creators**

> come to radblock.xyz, pay [a dollar], [verify your saic email address,] and upload a .gif. for the next [week], your .gif will be added to our pool of ad-replacement .gifs.

**for web users**

> install radblock and add art [by cutting-edge saic students] to your internet life

[1]: http://radblock.xyz.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
[2]: http://list.radblock.xyz.s3.amazonaws.com/list.json

nb

> we have radblock.xyz but dns isn't set up yet, append ".s3.amazonaws.com" to the urls in the list accordingly.
