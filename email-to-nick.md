Nick!

We (taylor and I) are making a plugin-thingy called radblock. It's like adblock, except it replaces ads with user-submitted art.

We have a webpage where someone can upload a gif [1], and another thingy that builds a list of the gifs [2].

[1]: http://radblock.xyz
[2]: http://list.radblock.xyz

Here's the pitch:

**community-platform**

> radblock is a platform for web-based artists at SAIC to show their work to an interested audience online. 

**for creators**

> come to radblock.xyz, pay [a dollar], [verify your saic email address,] and upload a .gif. for the next [week], your .gif will be added to our pool of ad-replacement .gifs.

**for web users**

> install radblock and add art [by cutting-edge saic students] to your internet life
