# major blurbs

[the `>` part is the blurb, the regular part is thoughts/comments

##  short top-of-website "this is radblock" get-your-interest type text for ppl who skip the video

> radblock is a platform for web-based artists at SAIC to show their work to an interested audience online. 

## maybe a longer "what is radblock" blurb/page?

##  some text for ppl uploading gifs 

x$? 24 hours? a week? saic-only? gifs? that are tiled? maybe some [shorter text that expands out into some longer text](https://skorokithakis.github.io/expounder/)

> come to radblock.xyz, pay [a dollar], [verify your saic email address,] and upload a .gif. for the next [week], your .gif will be added to our pool of ad-replacement .gifs.

##  some text for ppl downloading the plugin 

what does it do? how well does it work? is my browser supported? other stuff we don't know yet?

> install radblock and add art [by cutting-edge saic students] to your internet life

do we need separate text for [the plugin-store page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc)?
